#Python Variables and Strings

---

####Naming Restrictions

1. Letters must start with a letter or an underscore
2. The rest of the variable name must consist of letters, numbers or underscores
   - E.g. no symbols are allowed including !@#\$%^&\*()? etc.

####Naming Conventions

1. Variable names are snake_case
   - _Snake case means that lowercase letters with an undscore between the words_
2. Constants are CAPITAL_SNAKE_CASE
   - _An example of this is PI which refers to 3.14159..._
3. Classes are UpperCamelCase
   - _An example of this might be a Users class_
4. Private variables are **double_underscore** variables and should not be modified

###Data Types

- **Booleans**
  - Either True or False
- **Integers**
  - Whole numbers such as 1,2,3, ...
- **Strings**
  - A sequence of characters such as "Tim" or "Lorem ipsum dolor"
- **Lists**
  - An **ordered** sequence of values such as `[1,2,3]` or `['a','b','c']`
- **Dictionaries**
  - A collection of values such as `{"first_name": "Tim, "last_name": "Shores"}`

_There are a lot more data types in Python_

###Dynamic Typing

Dynamic typing means that a variable can be reassigned to a different data type.

###None

None is a special case in Python similiar to True or False. It's the Python equivalent of null in Javascript.
