# Big O Notation

---

**Motivation:** Imagine a problem has multiple implementations that solve the problem. How do we determine which solution is the best?

**Analogy:** Earthquakes are measured with the Richter scale from 1 to 10. This allows people to objectively discuss how powerful an earthquake hit. Big O Notation measures of how an algorithm's runtime scales as the inputs grows.

Constant Time - O(1)
Linear Time - O(n)
Quadratic Time - O(n^2)
